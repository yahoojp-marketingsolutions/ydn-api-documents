# SOAP Error Codes

### Error Process Outline
When a SOAP request is successful, YDN API sends back the "HTTP 200 OK" response code, along with a SOAP response. <br>
If an error occurs while a SOAP request is being processed, YDN API sends back a message with an error code. <br>
For details, please refer to [Error](/docs/en/api_reference/data/Error.md) and/or [ErrorDetail](/docs/en/api_reference/data/ErrorDetail.md).<br>
